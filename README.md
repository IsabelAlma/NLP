# NLP

The purpose of this project is to take what I have learned from my Natural Language Processing class and implement a Language Model. 

This model will display how many times a n-gram appears in a given string, the likelihood of a n-gram appearing, and eventually guess what the next n-gram will be.

Currently, the project counts alphabetical letter, from A to Z, and displays which letters appear in descending order. 
The next goal for this project is to display the probability of the letters appearing in a given text.
